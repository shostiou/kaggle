## Introduction

Performing OCR with SVM
SVM are well suited to tackle the challenge of image data.
With this projet we will perform Optical Character Recognition  

## Collecting data  

We will focus on A to Z recognition.  
We will use a dataset containing 20k examples of 26 Engligh alphabet capital letters.

```{r}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stedy/Machine-Learning-with-R-datasets/master/letterdata.csv"
download.file(url,"letterdata.csv")
```

The glyphs were converted to pixels + 16 statistical attributes.  
Horizontal/ vertical dimensions  
Average horizontal / vertical positions of pixels.  
Diff of B&W concentration  accross various areas.  

```{r}
letters <- read.csv("letterdata.csv")
str(letters)
```
